# DSND-Project-CRISP-DM
This code is for predicting COVID-19 from chest Xrays. The model currently has 95% accuracy.The python notebook attached contains the code for training and testing.


# Dataset
The dataset was collected from many sources. Currently this git repo is maintaining the COVID-19 Xray dataset:
https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

Dataset was divided into 2 classes: COVID-19 and Other (Pneumonia Viral,Pneumonia bacterial and normal)

# Model Statistics and Accuracy
VGG16 and InceptionV3 model were utilized as base models (InceptionV3 was finally used), the layers were freezed and on top of it some more layers were added. The model was trained on 318 samples of data and tested on 48 samples. The testing accuracy currently reported is 95%.
